                            Distribution is hereby defined as the act of making the Software available to others.
                            It does not refer to making copies of the Software. Distributing could mean making the
                            Software available on the Internet via the web, installing it onto physical media
                            intended for distribution, or any other means of transferring the Software from one
                            party to another.

                            You may distribute exact copies of the Software without any restrictions or obligations
                            provided you include an unmodified copy of this Licence with the distributed Software. Be
                            sure that any users of the Software have easy access to this Licence, by either linking to
                            it (<code>https://mingsutilities.com/LICENCE</code>), by copying it to a web page, or by any other means,
                            as long as the Licence remains unmodified and easily accessible. When distributing the Software,
                            you must also link to or in some other way make available the original, unmodified Source Code
                            associated with the Software.

                        <p>
                            To summarise, you may distribute exact copies of the Software without any restrictions or
                            obligations provided you include an unmodified copy of this Licence, ensuring that it is
                            easily accessible. The original, unmodified Source Code must also be distributed with the
                            Software and made easily available to users.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            If you have no plan to distribute the Software, but rather wish to simply have a copy,
                            modified or unmodified, for your own personal use, you are permitted to do so with only
                            a few conditions which are gone over in the Terms for Using the Software section of this
                            Licence.

                            Modifying is hereby defined as the act of making changes to the Software, whether for
                            your own personal use or for distribution, whether simple translations or complex
                            rearrangements.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            When distributing modified versions of the Software, be sure to keep this Licence, unmodified,
                            available to users. The Source Code for the modified Software must remain public and easily
                            accessible. There must be prominent notice of the modification, and the modified Source Code
                            must be distributed with the modified Software. Be sure that any users of the Software have easy access
