and its Source Code. This act is not prohibited by this Licence.

You are permitted to make exact copies of the Software and its Source Code and

If the Software is to be modified, be sure to read the Terms for Modifying the Software.

Distributing:

Distribution is hereby defined as the act of making the Software available to others.

intended for distribution, or any other means of transferring the Software from one
party to another.

You may distribute exact copies of the Software without any restrictions or obligations
provided you include an unmodified copy of this Licence with the distributed Software. Be

To summarise, you may distribute exact copies of the Software without any restrictions or
obligations provided you include an unmodified copy of this Licence, ensuring that it is
easily accessible. The original, unmodified Source Code must also be distributed with the

modified or unmodified, for your own personal use, you are permitted to do so with only
a few conditions which are gone over in the Terms for Using the Software section of this
Licence.

The Terms for distributing modified copies of the Software are gone over in the Modifying

rearrangements.

gone over in the Terms for Using the Software section of this Licence.

accessible. There must be prominent notice of the modification, and the modified Source Code
must be distributed with the modified Software. Be sure that any users of the Software have easy access
to this Licence, by either linking to it (https://mingsutilities.com/LICENSE), by copying it to a
web page, or by any other means, as long as the Licence remains unmodified and easily accessible. Be sure
